# coding-quiz
## Description
  In this project, my goal was to create a coding quiz app that would allow the user to test their knowledge of basic coding information. The user is presented with five coding related questions and a seventy second timer. The goal is to answer the questions correctly, and as quickly as possible. For every wrong answer, ten seconds are subtracted from the remaining time. The game is over when the last question is answered or the timer hits zero. The users score is whatever time is remaining when they answer the last question.
### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
